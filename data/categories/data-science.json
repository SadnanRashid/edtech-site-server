    "description": "This machine learning course will provide you with the fundamentals of how companies like Google, Amazon, and even Udemy use machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to derive meaning and information from huge data sets. Both Glassdoor and Indeed report that the median salary for a data scientist is $ 120,000. This is the standard, not the exception. Data scientists are desirable enough. It's hard to keep them staffed in today's tight job market. There is a severe shortage of people with the rare combination of scientific training, computer literacy and analytical talent. Today's data scientists are held to the same standards as the Wall Street quants of the 1980s and 1990s. When the need arose for innovative, physical and mathematical algorithms and approaches to data, they spilled over into databases, investments and hedge funds. So it's no surprise that data science is becoming a promising career path today. It has an analytical, code-driven approach done on a computer. As a result, it should come as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has grown steadily in the workplace over the past few years.",
