    "description": "Your time is precious and this is important to me, this course has been organized into small lessons that you can consume when you have a few free minutes. They follow each other, making the entire course viewable in a single session. you can rest assured that the project you embark on is the same as the project you deliver. On time and within budget. Acquiring software requirements, meeting deliverables, exceeding expectations and documenting the whole process can take years to learn, these things aren't taught in universities, they are learned in the trenches. So save time, get a scoop on the topics that matter. By the end of the course, you will have amassed a number of key information and several useful template files that together will take your software development skills to the next level. This course is for life, which means you can learn whenever you have the time. You have access to the discussion area, where I will personally answer all your questions about this course. This course is also backed by a 30 day money back guarantee.",
