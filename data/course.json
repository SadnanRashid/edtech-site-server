    "description": "This course is for anyone who wants to learn to understand requirements, define solutions for complex systems, and provide solutions that are scalable, scalable, and strong industrial applications. This course focuses on the modern application engineering methods and principles for approaching the design of flexible buildings required, and the movement of soil everywhere reactive solution can be repaired the benefits of cloud-based, cloud- and distributed, and decentralized architecture models, creating quality solutions and managing software projects. No Of course will introduce a variety of tools, as part of the same production print software. The goal is to have every student participate in the project a complete and useful tool that can be released for global use. This method is a highly interactive process, in which students are expected to participate activities and class discussions. Students will be encouraged to bring their own Communication skills, as many of the topics covered in this course are still available considered as an open research topic. More than 50% of the course will be dedicated to students demonstrations, practical exercises and practical software development in groups project.",

    "description": "Your time is precious and this is important to me, this course has been organized into small lessons that you can consume when you have a few free minutes. They follow each other, making the entire course viewable in a single session. you can rest assured that the project you embark on is the same as the project you deliver. On time and within budget. Acquiring software requirements, meeting deliverables, exceeding expectations and documenting the whole process can take years to learn, these things aren't taught in universities, they are learned in the trenches. So save time, get a scoop on the topics that matter. By the end of the course, you will have amassed a number of key information and several useful template files that together will take your software development skills to the next level. This course is for life, which means you can learn whenever you have the time. You have access to the discussion area, where I will personally answer all your questions about this course. This course is also backed by a 30 day money back guarantee.",
